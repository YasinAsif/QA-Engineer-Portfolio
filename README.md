## 📈 Weekly Updates

### Week 1: Testing Fundamentals (Oct 1-7, 2025) ✅

**Hours Invested:** 25 hours

**Achievements:**
- ✅ Completed ISTQB Foundation basics (20 pages)
- ✅ Created 20 professional test cases for Sauce Demo
- ✅ Found and documented 2 bugs with proper format
- ✅ Built reusable bug report template
- ✅ Learned SDLC, STLC, testing types in depth
- ✅ Set up GitHub portfolio structure
- ✅ Joined QA communities (Reddit)

**Key Learnings:**
- Difference between Severity (technical impact) vs Priority (business urgency)
- Importance of clear reproduction steps in bug reports
- Test case design requires thinking from user's perspective
- Documentation is as important as testing itself

**Challenges Faced:**
- Grasping the nuances between different SDLC models was confusing at first, especially how V-Model integrates testing so early.
- Overcame it by drawing diagrams and comparing them side-by-side in my notes, then applying them to the Sauce Demo project.

**Most Interesting Bug:**
- The UI glitch when adding items to cart as the "problem_user"—the button didn't update to "Remove," which highlighted how user-specific behaviors can expose hidden issues. It was tricky to reproduce consistently at first.

**Next Week Goals:**
- Master Git commands
- Learn Python basics
- Solve 20 HackerRank problems
