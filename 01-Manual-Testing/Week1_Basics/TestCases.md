## ✅ Recommendations

### For Development Team:

1. **Consider Testing with `problem_user`:**
   - This account intentionally has bugs
   - Recommended for separate bug testing cycle
   - Will help practice bug reporting skills

2. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   - Test on Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Verify consistent behavior across browsers
   - Check responsive design on mobile devices

3. **Additional Test Scenarios:**
   - Test with maximum cart items
   - Test with special characters in checkout form
   - Test browser back button behavior
   - Test session timeout scenarios

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - Load testing with multiple concurrent users
   - Stress testing cart operations
   - Network throttling tests (slow 3G)

5. **Security Testing:**
   - SQL injection attempts (tested briefly in TC-003)
   - XSS vulnerability testing
   - Session management testing

### For QA Process:

1. **Automation Opportunity:**
   - These test cases are good candidates for automation
   - Repetitive tests (login, add to cart) can be automated
   - Regression testing can be more efficient

2. **Test Data Expansion:**
   - Create additional test user accounts
   - Test with different product combinations
   - Test edge cases (very long names, special characters)

3. **Documentation:**
   - Screenshots recommended for bug reports
   - Video recordings for complex flows
   - Detailed environment setup documentation
